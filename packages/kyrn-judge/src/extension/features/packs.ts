 * Capability packs: installed with mu, out of the model's sight until a task
 * needs one. Each is one `judged` entry of the capability catalog, and its
 * tools are only registered when it is opened, so a closed pack costs the
 * model nothing. What a pack needs from the machine (ast-grep, git, gh, a debug adapter) is
 * looked for at that moment too: a missing program is an install hint to
 * whoever opened the pack, never an error at start-up.
 *
 * The commands a pack brings (`/review`, `/commit`) are the user's and are
 * always there. They open their pack themselves.
