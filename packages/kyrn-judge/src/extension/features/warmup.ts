/**
 * Keeps the connection to the judge warm while the session is in use.
 *
 * The first question of a turn is the one that waits for a connection, and
 * from a long route that is most of its time: measured 2026-09-23 from the
 * user's network, the questions asked before a turn take 1.7 s cold (HTTP/2)
 * or 3.9 s (HTTP/1.1) and 0.3-0.5 s warm, and the server drops a connection
 * idle for about 90 s. So while something happened in the last `idleMs`, one
 * trivial question goes out every `intervalMs`: 281 input tokens each, well
 * under a cent an hour. Not needed for a local sidecar, and not counted as a
 * decision.
