/**
 * FR-02, the task frame: what the user wants, kept current as the conversation
 * moves, and the one thing every "is this relevant to the goal" judgment reads.
 *
 * Who does what. The judge answers one choice question per user message: does
 * it change the frame, and how. Only on a change does a generative model (the
 * configured writer, else the session's model) write the new frame, and code
 * checks that every hard constraint is the user's own words. With no model at
 * all the rules in `frame.ts` apply. The first message needs neither.
 *
 * Event order, and why. Six features read `runtime.taskFrame()`, and the
 * update is asynchronous. The update starts inside `runtime.beginTurn`, which
 * preflight calls first thing on `input`, so it runs alongside preflight's own
 * judge call rather than after its wait. Preflight itself reads the frame
 * before that update exists, which is right: it asks how the message relates
 * to the task as it stood. This feature's `input` handler, registered right
 * after preflight, then waits for the update, bounded by `waitMs` counted from
 * when the message arrived. An update that is late is not dropped: the turn
 * starts on the previous version plus the raw message (`taskFrame()` shows it,
 * `frameStale` makes goal-based filters hold back), and the update lands when
 * it is ready, stamped with the turn that asked. Updates run one at a time, in
 * order, so a slow one cannot overwrite a newer one.
 *
 * Storage. Every version is a `kyrn.frame` session entry, written only once
 * the user message that caused it is in the session. `/tree` to a user message
 * moves the leaf to that message's parent, so an entry written before its
 * message would survive a rewind to it. The frame is rebuilt from the latest
 * entry on the current branch whenever the session starts or the tree moves.
 *
 * Shadow and off. The frame is infrastructure, so it exists in every mode:
 * version 1 from the first message, and the latest message shown as the
 * current subgoal, which is exactly what the stand-in gave the consumers
 * before. What shadow withholds is everything the judge's verdict would
 * cause: no writer call, no new version, no note. The verdict is recorded.
