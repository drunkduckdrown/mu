/**
 * The desktop app has a browser of its own, in the conversation's side panel.
 * When the app is running it offers that browser to the harness, so the
 * judge-driven loop drives a page the user can watch, pause and take over,
 * instead of a headless Chrome nobody sees.
 *
 * The app does not open a debugging port for itself. Its main process attaches
 * a debugger to the browsing pages only, and serves those over a loopback
 * WebSocket whose path carries a random token. It speaks the part of the
 * DevTools protocol the loop uses (`Target.*` to open, attach and close a tab,
 * then page-level methods), and a few methods of its own under `Mu.`:
 *
 *   Mu.hello    { version, session } -> { embedded: true, version }   tells the app apart from a plain Chrome
 *   Mu.run      { state, goal, url } | { state, status, reason, code, params? }   what the run is for, and how it ended
 *   Mu.control  -> { paused, stop }              asked before every step
 *   Mu.confirm  { label, url } -> { allowed }    the app's own dialog for irreversible actions
 *   Mu.step     { ...record }                    one line for the live overlay; no answer needed
 *
 * `session` is the app's name for the conversation this harness process serves (`MU_DESKTOP_SESSION`, set by
 * the app's adapter), so the tab opens beside the right conversation. Everything about one run is sent with
 * that tab's DevTools session id, because several runs can share one connection.
