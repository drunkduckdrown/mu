 * that is `judged` is installed but its tools stay out of the model's tool
 * list until the judge finds it relevant to the task, or the model asks for
 * it through `find_capability`. Its backing process starts only then.
 *
 * Hidden is never gone: every hidden capability can be found and opened by
 * the model, and a capability that had to be asked for is recorded as a miss,
 * which is the label a disclosure judge is later measured against.
