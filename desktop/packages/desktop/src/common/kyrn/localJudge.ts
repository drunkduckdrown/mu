 * The local judge (Laya) as the app manages it. Two runtimes, one contract on the same address:
 *
 * - coreml (Apple Silicon Macs): installed from the settings with one click after the person agrees to the download,
 *   started and stopped there. The main process runs the harness's own script,
 *   `kyrn/bin/kyrn-judge-local setup|start|stop`, so the app and `mu judge` in a terminal do the same thing.
 * - onnx (Windows, Linux): the app runs Laya itself (see `common/kyrn/layaOnnx.ts`). It never downloads the model:
 *   the person gets it from Hugging Face into the model folder, and the app checks it and starts the judge.
