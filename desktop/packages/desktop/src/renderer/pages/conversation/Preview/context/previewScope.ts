 * Preview isolation scope — the single switch point for "when does the preview

 * scope closes the open preview; staying within the same scope keeps it open.
 *
 * The scope dimension is the **project** (`project_id`), matching the product
 * model where the Explorer + preview are Project-level: switching conversations
 * within the same project keeps the preview open; switching project resets it.
 * Until the backend populates `conversation.project_id` (stage-3 contract), and
 * for conversations without a bound project, it falls back to the **workspace**
 * path — preserving the previous per-workspace behavior with no regression.
 *
 * Pure: no React, no I/O — so it is trivially unit-testable in isolation.
